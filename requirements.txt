1. Activate your virtual environment

If you created one (recommended):

cd "E:\APPP\MCQ App"
venv\Scripts\activate


If you didnâ€™t create one, skip this step.

2. Generate the requirements.txt

Run:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


This will create a requirements.txt file in your project folder with exact package versions, for example:

Flask==3.0.0
requests==2.31.0
Werkzeug==3.0.1
Jinja2==3.1.3
...

3. Verify the file

Open it to confirm:

notepad requirements.txt
